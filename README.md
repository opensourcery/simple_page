# Simple Page

Provides a Page Manager variant type that allows a page to exist and optionally allows setting that main page's content to that of a specific block.

The purpose of this module is to be able to use Page Manager to manage access control and variant selection to certain paths (like taxonomy term pages, for instance) in order to display content on those paths, without enabling Panels.

Essentially, this solves the "I want to use Page Manager but I can only can select 'HTTP response code' for my page variant" issue.
